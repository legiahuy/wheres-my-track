## Usage

You can now enter **either** a Spotify Track URI or a Spotify Track Link in the search form. The app will automatically convert a valid Spotify track link to the corresponding URI before searching.

### Example Inputs

- **Spotify Track URI:**
  ```
  spotify:track:1mZF9TEc7gpw7by7NCZSKr
  ```
- **Spotify Track Link:**
  ```
  https://open.spotify.com/track/1mZF9TEc7gpw7by7NCZSKr?si=V73PbQq_RfCXXDGH-gWwdQ
  ```

Both formats above will work. If you enter a link, it will be auto-parsed to the URI format before searching.
